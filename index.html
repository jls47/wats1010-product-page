	<h1>
		Improvement Starts Here!

	<p>
		The API Superstore is a product that saves business owners time and money (sort of) by introducing an easy-to-use service that helps you help yourself!  With our service, </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Google</li>
			<li>Facebook</li>
			<li>Twitter</li>
			<li>YouTube</li>
		</ul>
		<p>and even more integration are all just a click (or two) away with your subscription*!  With us, your site will go from deserted to barebones in an instant!
	</p>
	
	<p class="fineprint">
		1. All API links are generated by our own service.  Should your subscription lapse and the API links we provided are still in use, you may be subject to legal action.  We track IPs.  You cannot hide.

		<li>If you only purchase our basic package we will install a bitcoin miner on your computer.  It’s in the Terms & Conditions you probably won’t read!</li>
		<li>We waste so much time typing these out by hand.  God help our employees if a single one is repeated.M</li>
		<li>Think of it like the Golden Raspberry awards.</li>

		<p>The API Superstore revolutionized my business!  Now instead of a plain old garish website, I have a garish website with social media and YouTube integration!  Thanks, API Inc.!  -Ken M.</p>

		<p>Before I purchased the API Superstore, I had to make do with overly complicated tutorials.  I even had to find my own links, for God’s sake!  I got into business to sell pictures of Spiderman, not deal with this social media garbage!  I figured that instead of asking Parker to do it and having him bungle it, I’d cut out the middle-man and introduce the middle-service!  Best decision I've made since the last time I fired and re-hired half my staff! -J. Jameson</p>

		<p>This is a necessary service for anyone looking to get serious about their business’ presence on the web.  Not only is this service quick and convenient, but it’s easily worth the money!  -S. Arcasm</p>

		<p>This service is a window into the opportunistic, cynical side of the human being.  It is truly fascinating.  Plus, now I have a retweet button on my website! -W. Herzog</p>

		<p>For those who are just looking to get a quick start with their API installation.  Contains links and instructions to install services like Stage6, MySpace integration, and more!  Since we're so generous, we throw in access to one non-major advertising API!</p>

		<p>A great man once said, "It's business time".  If you're looking to get serious about your website, this is the tier for you.  This tier comes with access of a limited number of advertising APIs so that the serious webmasters can start earning*!</p>

For the reasonable price of an arm and a leg, we will provide a handy and efficient** search engine for literally any API you could think of.  If you're ready to grab the bull by the horns, this is the right place for you.</p>
